# My dot files

This is a very simple setup to help me when switching computers.

Symlinks need to be created for .zprofile, .tmux.conf, .vimrc

A local zprofile is expected at `~/.zprofile.local`

## Todo:
- [ ] Create script which
    - [ ] Creates a backup of config files
    - [ ] Installs sym links for vim, tmux, and zprofile and creates if needed
- [ ] Check for brew and installs if missing
- [ ] Git config aliases and fzf stuffs!
- [x] Checks for necessary utils and installs

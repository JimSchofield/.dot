# My dot files

This is a very simple setup to help me when switching computers.  The only involved config for zshell is really checking for required utilities.

## Todo:
Create an install script which
- [ ] Checks for brew and installs 
- [ ] Checks for necessary utils and installs 
- [ ] Creates sym links for vim, tmux, and zprofile
